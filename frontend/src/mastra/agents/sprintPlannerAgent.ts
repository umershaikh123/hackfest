    3. Progress analytics and charts (Medium Priority)
    4. Social sharing and challenges (Low Priority)

    User stories include:
    - As a fitness enthusiast, I want to create an account so I can save my workout data
    - As a user, I want to log my workouts so I can track my progress
    - As a user, I want to see my progress over time so I can stay motivated
    - As a user, I want to share achievements so I can motivate others

    We have a team of 5 developers and want to plan 3 two-week sprints. Can you create a sprint plan and set up Linear cycles if possible?
