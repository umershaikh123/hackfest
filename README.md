## 🏆 Hackathon Demo

Product Maestro is an innovative AI-powered platform that revolutionizes how product managers translate ideas into actionable development plans. Built with cutting-edge multi-agent AI orchestration, it eliminates the friction in product ideation and planning.

### 🎯 Problem We're Solving

Product managers face significant challenges in moving from concept to execution:
- **Fragmented workflows** across multiple tools and platforms
- **Manual documentation** that slows time-to-market
- **Communication gaps** between product vision and engineering
- **High overhead** in creating user stories, wireframes, and PRDs

### 💡 Our Solution

A single, conversational interface that guides PMs from raw ideas to comprehensive product plans through specialized AI agents.
