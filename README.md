## 🔧 **Current Working State & Usage**

### ✅ **What Works Now**

**Individual Agent Calls** (Ready for Frontend Integration):
```typescript
// Feedback routing works perfectly
await feedbackRouterAgent.generate(userFeedback)

// All individual agents respond correctly  
await ideaGenerationAgent.generate(rawIdea)
await userStoryGeneratorAgent.generate(productIdea)
await prdAgent.generate(prdData)
```

**Tool Execution** (All tools work correctly):
```typescript
await feedbackRouterTool.execute({ context: feedbackData })
await ideaGenerationTool.execute({ context: ideaData })
await prdGeneratorTool.execute({ context: prdData })
```

**Working Test Commands**:
```bash
# ✅ These work perfectly
npm run test:feedback    # 83% success rate
npm run test:idea        # Full success 
npm run test:prd         # Individual PRD components work
npm run test:sprint      # Individual sprint components work
npm run test:visual      # Individual visual components work

# ⚠️ These have workflow chaining issues
npm run test:conversational  # Workflow data flow broken
npx tsx src/test/testEndToEnd.ts  # Step chaining issues
```

### 🛠️ **For Frontend Developers**

**Recommended Integration Approach**:
1. **Use Individual Agents** - All agents work perfectly when called directly
2. **Implement Custom Orchestration** - Build workflow logic in frontend/API layer
3. **Session Management** - Use feedback router for conversation state
4. **Progressive Enhancement** - Start with working agents, add workflow later

**Example Frontend Integration**:
```typescript
// This pattern works reliably
const ideaResult = await ideaGenerationAgent.generate(userInput)
const storyResult = await userStoryGeneratorAgent.generate(ideaResult)
const prdResult = await prdAgent.generate({ idea: ideaResult, stories: storyResult })
```
