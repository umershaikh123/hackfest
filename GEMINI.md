Project Proposal: Product Maestro

1. Project Title
   Product Maestro: The Conversational, No-Code IDE for Product Managers
2. Problem Statement
   Product managers and leaders often face significant friction in translating nascent ideas into actionable development plans. The current process is fragmented, involving:
   Disjointed brainstorming sessions.
   Manual creation of user stories.
   Tedious generation of wireframes and mockups, often requiring design tools or external teams.
   Laborious drafting of Product Requirements Documents (PRDs).
   Manual sprint planning based on features.
   This fragmentation leads to:
   Slow Time-to-Market: Delays in getting ideas from concept to actionable development.
   Communication Gaps: Misalignment between product vision, design, and engineering.
   Reduced Iteration Speed: Difficulty in quickly visualizing and refining ideas.
   High Overhead: Excessive time spent on documentation and manual processes.
   Existing solutions like "Lovable, v0" and "bolt.new" offer glimpses but often lack a comprehensive, integrated, and truly conversational experience for the entire product definition lifecycle, particularly from a PM's perspective.
3. Solution Overview
   Product Maestro is an AI-powered, no-code/low-code development environment designed specifically for product managers. It provides a seamless, conversational UI that guides PMs from a raw app idea to a comprehensive product plan, including user stories, visual wireframes, a detailed PRD, and a preliminary sprint plan.
   Leveraging Mastra.ai's multi-agent framework and intelligent workflows, Product Maestro automates and integrates key stages of product ideation and planning, enabling rapid iteration and clear communication without requiring any coding knowledge from the user.

4. Key Features
   Product Maestro will empower product managers with the following capabilities:
   Conversational Idea Brainstorming:
   Users explain app ideas in plain English via a chat interface.
   An AI agent (Idea Generation Agent) engages in a dialogue to ask clarifying questions, refine the concept, suggest features, and identify the core problem/solution.
   Automated User Story Generation:
   Based on the refined app idea and features, an AI agent (User Story Generator Agent) automatically generates well-structured user stories (As a [persona], I want to [action] so that [benefit]).
   Ability for users to review, edit, and accept generated stories.
   Dynamic Wireframe & Mockup Generation:
   An AI agent (Visual Design Agent) interprets the app idea and user stories to propose visual designs.
   These designs are dynamically rendered in the UI using Shadcn/UI components, providing instant visual feedback as no-code wireframes/mockups.
   Users can provide feedback on designs via conversation (e.g., "Change the button to green," "Add a new section for comments"), and the AI will update the visuals accordingly.
   Comprehensive PRD Generation:
   On-demand, an AI agent (PRD Agent) compiles all gathered information (idea, features, user stories, design notes, target audience) into a structured Product Requirements Document.
   The PRD follows industry-standard formats, ready for sharing with engineering and design teams.
   Preliminary Sprint Planning:
   An AI agent (Sprint Planner Agent) takes the defined features and user stories to propose a realistic, high-level sprint breakdown.
   This provides a preliminary roadmap for development, assisting in project kickoff.
   Intuitive User Interface (Next.js):
   A single, cohesive web interface where all interactions (chat, visual design, document viewing) occur seamlessly.
   Real-time updates as AI agents process information.

5. Architecture & Technology Stack
   Backend & AI Core: Mastra.ai (TypeScript)
   Mastra.ai Agents:
   Idea Generation Agent: Focuses on concept refinement and feature identification.
   User Story Generator Agent: Specializes in crafting structured user stories.
   Visual Design Agent: Translates textual descriptions into visual UI component specifications.
   PRD Agent: Structures and populates comprehensive product requirement documents.
   Sprint Planner Agent: Decomposes features into actionable sprint tasks.
   Router/Feedback Analysis Agent (Internal): Directs user feedback to the appropriate agent for iterative refinement.
   Mastra.ai Workflows: The central orchestration layer.
   Manages the sequence of agent interactions (e.g., Idea -> User Story -> Design -> PRD -> Sprint Plan).
   Implements conditional branching (e.g., "if user provides design feedback, re-run Visual Design Agent").
   Handles "human-in-the-loop" scenarios using suspend() and resume() to wait for user input.
   Ensures data integrity and type safety between steps using zod.
   Mastra.ai Tools:
   ShadcnUIGeneratorTool: A custom tool to output structured data representing Shadcn/UI components, which the frontend can render.
   RAG Query Tool: For querying internal knowledge bases.
   Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):
   Vector Database (e.g., PostgreSQL with pgvector): Stores internal knowledge base for agents, including:
   UI/UX best practices and design patterns.
   Shadcn/UI component documentation (structured for AI understanding).
   Common user personas and user story templates.
   Standard PRD formats and sprint planning methodologies.
   Embedding Model: To convert text into vector embeddings for RAG queries.
   Frontend: Next.js (React, TypeScript)
   Real-time Chat Interface: Displays AI-generated responses and allows user input.
   Dynamic Wireframe Canvas: Renders Shadcn/UI components generated by the Visual Design Agent.
   Interactive Document Views: Displays generated user stories, PRDs, and sprint plans in an organized and user-friendly format.
   API Layer: Connects the Next.js frontend to the Mastra.ai backend (likely via a custom API route or a direct connection if Mastra.ai is exposed as an MCP server).
   External Integrations:
   Large Language Models (LLMs): OpenAI GPT series (e.g., gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini) via @ai-sdk/openai.
   Speech-to-Text (Stretch Goal): Web Speech API or a cloud-based STT service (e.g., Google Cloud Speech-to-Text) for voice input.
6. User Experience & Design Philosophy
   Conversational Simplicity: The primary mode of interaction is natural language, making it accessible to non-technical users.
   Single Pane of Glass: All aspects of product ideation and planning are consolidated into one intuitive UI, eliminating context switching.
   Visual Feedback: Instant rendering of wireframes provides tangible progress and facilitates quicker design decisions.
   Iterative Refinement: The system is designed to embrace feedback, allowing product managers to easily tweak and refine their ideas until satisfied.
   Minimalist & Focused: UI will be clean and uncluttered, focusing on the core task of product definition.
7. Innovation & Differentiation
   Truly Conversational & Multi-Agent: Goes beyond simple chat bots by orchestrating multiple specialized AI agents through sophisticated workflows to handle complex, multi-stage tasks.
   Integrated Visual Design (No-Code): Directly generates and displays interactive wireframes using a popular component library (Shadcn/UI), eliminating the need for separate design tools or manual mockups.
   End-to-End Product Planning: Covers the entire spectrum from raw idea to sprint plan, providing a holistic solution.
   Human-in-the-Loop Design: Workflows are explicitly designed to pause and solicit user feedback, making the AI a collaborative assistant rather than a black box.
   TypeScript-Native AI (Mastra.ai): Leverages a modern, type-safe framework, appealing to a broader developer base and enabling robust, production-ready AI applications.
8. Business Viability
   Product Maestro addresses a significant pain point for product-led organizations. Its value proposition includes:
   Accelerated Product Development: Significantly reduces the time and effort required to move from concept to a defined product plan.
   Improved Collaboration: Provides a shared, living document (the PRD) and visual artifacts that foster better understanding between PMs, designers, and engineers.
   Empowerment for PMs: Allows product managers to have greater ownership and direct influence over early-stage product design.
   Cost Savings: Reduces reliance on external design resources for initial mockups and streamlines documentation efforts.
   Scalability: The modular agent-based architecture built with Mastra.ai allows for easy expansion with new agents, tools, and integrations as needs evolve.
9. Stretch Goals (if time permits)
   Voice Mode: Enable users to speak their ideas and feedback instead of typing.
   Version Control for Ideas/PRDs: Basic versioning to track changes in product definitions.
   Export Options: Export PRD to Markdown, PDF, or integration with project management tools (e.g., Jira, Asana) for sprint plans.
   User Testing Insights: AI suggests potential user testing scenarios based on the defined features.
   Competitive Analysis Integration: AI can briefly research competitive products based on the idea.

Multi-Agent Workflows (Mastra.ai Workflows)
Mastra.ai's workflow engine will be essential for chaining these agents together.
Initial Idea to Wireframe Flow:
User input (plain English app idea).
Idea Generation Agent refines the idea and extracts core features.
Output passed to User Story Generator Agent to create user stories.
Output (refined idea + user stories) passed to Visual Design Agent.
Visual Design Agent generates wireframe descriptions/components for Next.js.
Frontend displays wireframes.
User Edit & Refine Flow:
User provides feedback on wireframes or asks for changes.
A Router Agent (another Mastra agent) determines which agent needs to be invoked based on the feedback (e.g., if it's a design change, go to Visual Design Agent; if it's a feature change, go back to Idea Generation Agent).
The relevant agent processes the feedback and updates its output.
The workflow continues, potentially regenerating user stories or designs.
PRD Generation Flow (On-Demand):
User explicitly requests a PRD.
PRD Agent gathers all current information from the previous steps (idea, features, user stories, design notes).
PRD Agent generates the document.
Sprint Planning Flow (On-Demand):
User explicitly requests a sprint plan.
Sprint Planner Agent takes the current set of user stories and features.
Sprint Planner Agent generates the sprint breakdown.

Frontend (Next.js) - The UI for the Product Manager
Interactive Chat Interface: The primary mode of interaction. Users converse with the "Product Maestro" and its underlying agents.
Dynamic Content Display:
User Stories: Displayed in a clear, formatted list, possibly with drag-and-drop reordering.
Wireframe Canvas: A dedicated area to render the shadcn/ui components generated by the Visual Design Agent. This would be the "no-code" part where PMs see their app come to life.
Component Library: Pre-import all necessary shadcn/ui components into your Next.js app so they can be rendered dynamically.
Interactive Elements: Make the rendered wireframes semi-interactive (e.g., click on a button to simulate navigation to another screen).
PRD View: A well-formatted, collapsible document view for the generated PRD.
Sprint Plan View: A kanban board-like display for sprint tasks.
Input Mechanisms:
Text input for ideas and feedback.
Voice Mode (Stretch Goal): Implement a speech-to-text library (e.g., Web Speech API, or a cloud-based STT service) to allow voice input for brainstorming.
Real-time Updates: As agents process information, the UI should update dynamically. Mastra.ai's streaming capabilities will be key here for a smooth UX

Comments
See heading 4 Key features and continue implementing the rest of the agents
We want to integrate external tools with these agents for example in sprint agent planner we can use jira api or linear to make tickets , for PRD use notion to store all the requirement and documentation . You can either call api or use MCP servers for this see mastra mcp documentation
Try to use MCP servers in our tools to give more functionality
