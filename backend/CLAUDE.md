2. **Run build first**: `npm run build` 
3. **Then start dev server**: `npm run dev`

This ensures the Mastra build system is properly initialized before starting the development server.

#### Known Issues & Workarounds

**⚠️ Workflow Step Chaining Issues**
- **Problem**: End-to-end workflows fail due to data flow issues between steps
- **Workaround**: Use individual agents directly instead of workflows
- **Status**: Working on fix for step result mapping

**⚠️ Schema Validation Errors**
- **Problem**: Some tools expect different input structures than workflow provides
- **Workaround**: Test individual components which work correctly
- **Example**: User story tool expects different persona structure

**✅ Recommended Testing Approach**
```bash
# Use these working tests for validation
npm run test:feedback     # Test feedback routing (83% success)
npm run test:idea        # Test idea generation (100% success)
npx tsx src/test/simpleEndToEndTest.ts  # System validation (83% success)
```

**🔧 Frontend Integration Guidance**
- **Use Individual Agents**: All agents work perfectly when called directly
- **Avoid End-to-End Workflows**: Current workflow chaining has data flow issues
- **Session Management**: Use feedback router for conversation state
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with working components, add workflow later

## Project Overview - Product Maestro: The Conversational, No-Code IDE for Product Managers

### 1. Problem Statement

Product managers and leaders often face significant friction in translating nascent ideas into actionable development plans. The current process is fragmented, involving:

- Disjointed brainstorming sessions.
- Manual creation of user stories.
- Tedious generation of wireframes and mockups, often requiring design tools or external teams.
- Laborious drafting of Product Requirements Documents (PRDs).
- Manual sprint planning based on features.

This fragmentation leads to:

- **Slow Time-to-Market:** Delays in getting ideas from concept to actionable development.
- **Communication Gaps:** Misalignment between product vision, design, and engineering.
- **Reduced Iteration Speed:** Difficulty in quickly visualizing and refining ideas.
- **High Overhead:** Excessive time spent on documentation and manual processes.

Existing solutions like "Lovable, v0" and "bolt.new" offer glimpses but often lack a comprehensive, integrated, and truly conversational experience for the entire product definition lifecycle, particularly from a PM's perspective.

### 2. Solution Overview

Product Maestro is an AI-powered, no-code/low-code development environment designed specifically for product managers. It provides a seamless, conversational UI that guides PMs from a raw app idea to a comprehensive product plan, including user stories, visual wireframes, a detailed PRD, and a preliminary sprint plan.

Leveraging Mastra.ai's multi-agent framework and intelligent workflows, Product Maestro automates and integrates key stages of product ideation and planning, enabling rapid iteration and clear communication without requiring any coding knowledge from the user.

### 3. Key Features

Product Maestro will empower product managers with the following capabilities:

- **Conversational Idea Brainstorming:** Users explain app ideas in plain English via a chat interface. An AI agent (Idea Generation Agent) engages in a dialogue to ask clarifying questions, refine the concept, suggest features, and identify the core problem/solution.
- **Automated User Story Generation:** Based on the refined app idea and features, an AI agent (User Story Generator Agent) automatically generates well-structured user stories (As a [persona], I want to [action] so that [benefit]). Ability for users to review, edit, and accept generated stories.
- **Professional Visual Design & Miro Integration:** The Visual Strategist Agent creates stunning visual artifacts including user journey maps, process workflow diagrams, and professional persona cards. These are rendered in interactive Miro boards with modern design elements, proper visual hierarchy, and stakeholder-ready presentation quality. Supports multiple design types: comprehensive boards, user journeys, and process workflows.
- **Comprehensive PRD Generation:** On-demand, an AI agent (PRD Agent) compiles all gathered information (idea, features, user stories, design notes, target audience) into a structured Product Requirements Document. The PRD follows industry-standard formats, ready for sharing with engineering and design teams.
- **Preliminary Sprint Planning:** An AI agent (Sprint Planner Agent) takes the defined features and user stories to propose a realistic, high-level sprint breakdown. This provides a preliminary roadmap for development, assisting in project kickoff.
- **Intuitive User Interface (Next.js):** A single, cohesive web interface where all interactions (chat, visual design, document viewing) occur seamlessly. Real-time updates as AI agents process information.
